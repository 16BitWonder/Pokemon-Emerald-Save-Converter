These tools were only designed and tested for US Pokemon Emerald save file conversions!

Should you bork your saves from other pokemon games or from Emerald of a different region,
then you have no one to blame but yourself!

=========
= Usage =
=========

-->IMPORTANT<--
Your save files MUST be named "Pokemon Emerald.sav" or "Pokemon Emerald.srm" when placed
into the specified folders (case sensitive!), otherwise the tools will not see them and
obviously will not convert them.
-->IMPORTANT<--

Your directory should look like this: Directory/SavToSrm/
                                                SrmToSav/
                                                README.txt
                                                SavToSrm.jar
                                                SrmToSav.jar

-If you are converting a .sav save, place it into the "SavToSrm" folder, and
-launch the SavToSrm.jar. Your converted save should appear in the same directory
-as the jar files.

-If you are converting a .srm save, place it into the "SrmToSav" folder, and
-launch the SrmToSav.jar. Your converted save should appear in the same directory
-as the jar files.

If you paid money for this... Why?	(Also go get your money back)

These tools are provided as is, and I am in no way liable if you somehow bork your saves
or something else with them.

That being said, the only way you could bork your save would be if you put a .srm into the 
SavToSrm folder and tried to convert it into .srm again. Or if you put a .sav into the 
SrmToSav folder and tried to convert it into .sav again.
